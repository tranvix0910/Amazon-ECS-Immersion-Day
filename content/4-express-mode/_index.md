In this section, we will learn about **Amazon ECS Express Mode** — a simplified container deployment solution that allows developers to launch containerized applications with High Availability and Scalability with just a single command.

By automating infrastructure setup and following AWS best practices, ECS Express Mode eliminates the complexity of container orchestration, while still maintaining full access to Amazon ECS capabilities when needed.

This helps development teams focus on building applications, instead of having to manage infrastructure components such as load balancing, auto-scaling, and networking.
