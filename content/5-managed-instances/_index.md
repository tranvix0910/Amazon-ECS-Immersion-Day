Amazon ECS Managed Instances is a fully managed compute option that eliminates the burden of infrastructure management while still providing access to the rich EC2 ecosystem, including:

- Flexibility to choose instance type
- Access to reserved capacity
- Advanced security and observability configuration

By delegating operational tasks to AWS, ECS Managed Instances helps you get started faster and reduces total cost of ownership (TCO).
